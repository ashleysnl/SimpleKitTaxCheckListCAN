## SimpleKit V2 authoring precedence

For V2 development, use the maintained [Core authoring contract](https://github.com/ashleysnl/SimpleKit-Core/blob/49de30920a878b4b23c09a9803b7cacf3d1d41ba/docs/v2-authoring/README.md), [style guide](https://github.com/ashleysnl/SimpleKit-Core/blob/49de30920a878b4b23c09a9803b7cacf3d1d41ba/docs/v2-authoring/calculator-style-guide.md), [master Codex prompt](https://github.com/ashleysnl/SimpleKit-Core/blob/49de30920a878b4b23c09a9803b7cacf3d1d41ba/docs/v2-authoring/master-codex-build-prompt.md), [starter](https://github.com/ashleysnl/SimpleKit-Core/blob/49de30920a878b4b23c09a9803b7cacf3d1d41ba/starter/v2/README.md) and [spec template](https://github.com/ashleysnl/SimpleKit-Core/blob/49de30920a878b4b23c09a9803b7cacf3d1d41ba/docs/v2-authoring/calculator-spec.template.yaml).

This V2 contract supersedes legacy directions below that require a large gradient hero, the old starter palette/font stack, mutable CDN header/footer injection, a universal two-column layout, or unavailable Mac-only prompts. Preserve the existing local financial spec, formulas, defaults, IDs, state/import/export, routes, metadata and analytics. Existing implementations are the starting point; do not regenerate the tool from the starter.

Common theme/components belong in Core; tool-specific presentation/behavior belongs here. Use the site's deliberately adopted immutable Core runtime pin and local asset assembly, one opt-in System v1/theme 1.1 shell, compact task introductions and normal-flow footer support. Do not mount a second legacy shell. The documentation revision above is not an instruction to repin unchanged runtime assets.

Work on synchronized `develop-v2`; preserve unrelated/uncommitted work and main/production. During implementation inspect the diff, build one coherent batch and briefly check touched mobile/desktop behavior. Defer broad fixtures/audits/browser matrices to the site's Phase 16 candidate; keep unverified work `[~]` and preserve mandatory CI. Never publish production from this authoring task.

The original Factory workspace paths remain historical provenance. Its generator was unavailable during this update; a future regeneration must adopt this maintained V2 source contract rather than restoring contradictory legacy directions.

## SimpleKit Factory Context

This calculator repo was bootstrapped from the local SimpleKit App Factory.

Treat these files as the primary build context for this repo:

- local calculator spec: `calculator-spec.yaml`
- local factory handoff: `.factory/build-prompt.md`
- local session notes: `.factory/SESSION.md`
- local build checklist: `.factory/TODO.md`

The source files in the factory repo are:

- master build prompt: `/Users/AshleySkinner/Documents/00_Engineering/04_Code/50_SimpleKit App Factory/prompts/master-codex-build-prompt.md`
- UI/UX review prompt: `/Users/AshleySkinner/Documents/00_Engineering/04_Code/50_SimpleKit App Factory/prompts/ui-ux-review-prompt.md`
- final QA prompt: `/Users/AshleySkinner/Documents/00_Engineering/04_Code/50_SimpleKit App Factory/prompts/final-qa-prompt.md`
- landing page update prompt: `/Users/AshleySkinner/Documents/00_Engineering/04_Code/50_SimpleKit App Factory/prompts/landing-page-update-prompt.md`
- style guide: `/Users/AshleySkinner/Documents/00_Engineering/04_Code/50_SimpleKit App Factory/references/style-guide/simplekit-calculator-style-guide.md`
- launch checklist: `/Users/AshleySkinner/Documents/00_Engineering/04_Code/50_SimpleKit App Factory/docs/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`

## Working Rules

- Use `calculator-spec.yaml` as the source of truth for this tool.
- Preserve the existing SimpleKit template architecture unless there is a strong reason not to.
- Keep the tool static-site friendly.
- Prefer the live tool-link catalog included in the template repo for SimpleKit internal links if available.
- Make assumptions explicit when the spec is incomplete.
- Keep reusable workflow assets in the factory repo and reusable implementation improvements in the template repo.

## Review Flow

When asked to review this calculator:

- use `/Users/AshleySkinner/Documents/00_Engineering/04_Code/50_SimpleKit App Factory/prompts/ui-ux-review-prompt.md` for UI/UX reviews
- use `/Users/AshleySkinner/Documents/00_Engineering/04_Code/50_SimpleKit App Factory/prompts/final-qa-prompt.md` for pre-launch QA reviews

## SimpleKit V2 source workflow

- V2 development occurs on `develop-v2`. Synchronize that branch before work; keep `main`, production hosting and DNS unchanged until separately authorized release.
- This source is bundled at an immutable SHA by `ashleysnl/simplekit-site`; preserve calculator IDs, formulas, persistence, exports, canonical URLs and analytics. Shared V2 components live in SimpleKit-Core.
- Follow the site’s V2 roadmap and owner’s implementation-first cadence: inspect source changes and build each coherent batch; defer exhaustive numerical/state, SEO, accessibility and browser checks to Phase 16. Record implementation as pending verification until those checks pass.
